# How to Buy and Sell LLM & LLD on Decentralized Exchanges

As of now, there are no native decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the Liberland chain. Nevertheless, you can bridge your LLM or LLD to and from the Ethereum network, which opens access to numerous Ethereum DEXes.

To transfer your funds to and from Ethereum, please visit the [bridge](https://blockchain.liberland.org/home/wallet/eth-bridge/deposit).

## Exchanging LLM & LLD

Firstly, ensure you have an Ethereum wallet with enough Ether to cover transaction fees. 

If you're selling, bridge your LLM or LLD from the Liberland chain to Ethereum using the [bridge](https://blockchain.liberland.org/home/wallet/eth-bridge/deposit). If you're buying, you need to have funds available to purchase LLM or LLD. [ERC-20 USDT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether) is often the most cost-effective choice as it typically has the lowest swap fees.

You can swap LLM & LLD on Uniswap, but they are not yet included on Uniswap's default Token List. Consequently, Uniswap will display a warning indicating that these tokens are not traded on leading centralized exchanges. This is expected, and you can proceed safely as long as you use the trusted links provided for trading. Avoid trading LLM & LLD through other links or means because their authenticity cannot be guaranteed.
